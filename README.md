# wolf4sdl

Branched from the [ichera fork](https://bitbucket.org/ichera/wolf4sdl/branch/sdl2) to get sdl2 support and
copied some cmake files from [ecwolf](https://bitbucket.org/ichera/wolf4sdl/branch/sdl2) to make it compilable in macOS without xcode.

Usage:

    $ make deps
    $ make build
    $ cp ~/Path/to/Wolf/Data/*.wl6 data
    $ make run
